# VueTodo V2
Functionality the same as as in [VueTodo V1](https://github.com/johnveloper/vue-todo-v1), but significant change in code. I learnt how to create and use components, and applied it to this iteration of my VueTodo.

## Improvements from V1
- Better, cleaner source thanks to utilizing Vue components,
- Removed 2 too bright themes,
- Black theme is default now,
- When you hover on item holding shift, the item turns red (delete item with shift + click),
- Item deletion confirmation on mobile (when deleting with tapping and holding for 500ms).
